# Loyalty-Program-and-Promotional-Analysis
## Hugh’s Organics is a regional grocer operating in Eastern Europe (i.e. Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary), and have opened a new store in Berlin to expand into new markets. They have run a loyalty program for the last 10 years and have recently engaged your company to help design a short-term promotion. 
### Loyalty members receive a base offer of 1 point for every $10 spent in store.  For example, if a person spends $18 in store one day, and $35 the next, they would earn 1 point the first day and 3 points the following day. For ease of calculations, assume an additional 10% of points were issued as bonus points from various promotions. A total of 1,500 customers redeemed 150,000 points in 2007, for $1,500 off their groceries.
#### Provide an assessment of the loyalty programs performance:
•	What is the penetration of the loyalty program in 2007? You may want to consider both the penetration in the number of baskets as well as the penetration in total spend.
o	If from industry benchmarks you’ve researched that basket penetration is typically 60% for similar grocers, and revenue penetration is typically 90%, what does that suggest about how well this program is doing?
•	What is total issuance in 2007?
o	What does the issuance vs redemption suggest about whether the program works for your customers?
•	Is there anything else you feel Hugh’s Organics should know about how their customers behave?



## Promotional Analysis
### Hugh’s Organics recently ran a promotion in their new Berlin store, E01. For the month of June 2018, with each transaction, customers enter a draw for a variety of prizes with each purchase. The promo cost a total of $5,000 to run (includes advertising, prizes etc.). Use descriptive analytics to evaluate whether this is a good promotion to run again or more frequently, and feel free to include any recommendations or thoughts you have based off your findings. What worked and what didn’t? How could things be changed or improved? Consider using store E03 in Budapest as a control market where the promotion was not run.
